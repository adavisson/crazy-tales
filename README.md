# Crazy Tales
This purpose of this project is to start learning React hooks. It will mimic the same functionality as my Wacky Stories project, but instead of building out an API, it will use the MadLibz API found here: https://madlibz.herokuapp.com/api

## Notes
This app is now functional and is hosted at https://crazy-tales.andydavisson.com
